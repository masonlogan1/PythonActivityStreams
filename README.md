# PythonActivityStreams
PythonActivityStreams is an implementation of the objects described in the ActivtyStreams Terminology document. All
objects described are implemented as individual classes capable of being instantiated either by providing the arguments
or providing a string to be parsed. Objects contain PyLD-equivalent methods to produce compressed and expanded strings
